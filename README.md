i think human consciousness is a tragic misstep in evolution, we became to self aware. Nature created an aspect of nature 
seperate from itself. We are creatures that should not exist by natural law, we are things that labor under the illusion of having
a self, that accretion of sensory experience and feelings, progranmmed with total assurance that we are each somebody when in
fact everybody's nobody. I think the honourbale thing for our species to do is to deny our programming, stop reproducing and walk 
hand in hand into extinction.
